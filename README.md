This is my first Godot project that started with some youtube tutorial to get to know what it is and how to add things. Haven't finished that tutorial due to having fun doing on my own.
It's still a fun project with no big plans, I just add whatever pops up in my head. Although I want to structurize it a little, when I get more of an idea of what it should be. This is also an architecture, planning and designing lesson for me.

What this game is (will be) about?
I'd like to make it a wizard game, where a player is a wizard that can't fight nor attack enemies directly. Instead wizard is using magic to control the surroundings, that's why I want to focus on making it very interactable and add some kind of complexity. My wish is to make a more advanced magic system where wizard has to control very simple things, elements and combine some actions to provide more powerfull spells, which is what I seek in magic.

For now almost all the assets are borowed from the internet (free license assets), although I'd like to change it in a future, even if it'd be uglier. The interactive objects like tree and fallen tree are made by me.
